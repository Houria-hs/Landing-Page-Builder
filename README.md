🚀 NovaBuild Landing Page Builder

🌟 Project Overview

[MVP] The Landing Page Builder is currently a Minimum Viable Product focused on delivering a foundational, component-based visual editor. It allows users to quickly assemble and preview simple, responsive landing pages using a core set of pre-built blocks. The primary goal of this MVP is to validate the drag-and-drop editing experience and secure user data through robust authentication, paving the way for advanced features like Auto Smart Alignment and Real-Time Collaboration in future releases.

This project is built with a modern React architecture, utilizing a component-based system and Tailwind CSS for rapid, utility-first styling.
